# Diagnose-MS-Patients

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most serious and widespread diseases, according to statistics published by the Atlas of (MS) and this is the open-source global compendium of data regarding the epidemiology of (MS). 

The number of people affected by multiple sclerosis has reached 2.8 million worldwide, and this number is rapidly increasing, and the early detection is Leading to successful treatment and reducing the progression of the disease significantly. 

MS appears in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain or spinal cord and has various forms with white color called (MS lesions) and different levels of spread and appearance depending on the severity and progression of the disease depending on the condition of the patient.

In this project, we will contribute to the early detection of this disease by creating a system that utilizes deep learning techniques for classifying lesions in MS. 

This is achieved by inputting multiple images of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features and classify images that contain lesions versus images that are healthy.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we conducted experiments on a dataset Mendeley data website and the system achieves accuracy 74% in MS detection.

Our proposed automated Multiple sclerosis detection system has the potential to assist medical professionals in detecting cancerous tissues accurately and efficiently and this system we aim to enhance it to achieve higher accuracy than its current state.
